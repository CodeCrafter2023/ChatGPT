>>> Prompt for creating a layout:
I need a HTML page created with the following specifications: 

The layout should consist of a sidebar, a top bar, a main section, and a footer. 
The sidebar is positioned on the left-hand side.
The sidebar has a width of 300 pixels, and its height is equal to the height of the viewport.
The top bar is positioned on the right-hand side
The top bar has a height of 50 pixels, and it will occupy the remaining horizontal space.
The main section should be positioned below the top bar and take up the remaining vertical space.
The combined height of the top bar and main section is equal to the height of the sidebar.
The footer should be located at the bottom of the page, with a height of 300px.

There should be no gaps or margins between the sidebar, top bar, main section, and footer.
There should also be no gaps around the page itself.
Please utilize the "div" element exclusively for all these sections.
Please use the 'display: grid' property to create the desired layout design. 
The layout should be as follows:
sidebar topbar
sidebar main
footer footer

I need you to add labels to these sections with a plain text, no css or <label> is required.
I'd like you to select a font for this web page that will be applied throughout the entire page. 

I'd like you to use the color #2D4D78 as the base color for this web page. 
The top bar background color should be slightly darker than this color.
The sidebar background color should be slightly lighter than this color.
The main section background color should be lighter than a light gray color. 
The footer background color should be colored in light gray.

Please add a title section in main section with <h2>. 
The title should have the same color as the top bar and should occupy the full width of the page.
